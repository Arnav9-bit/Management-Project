1763666021,B0DXPL5XHF,RGQJZGPGR49OJ,King of Battery Life with Great Sound (Value for Money!),"I've been using the boAt Nirvana Zenith Pro and I'm genuinely impressed for the price. The biggest win here is the battery life—it seriously lasts forever. You can go days without worrying about charging the case, which is a huge plus. The sound quality is fantastic if you like a strong, punchy bass. It's perfect for pop, hip-hop, and watching movies because the Spatial Audio feature makes everything sound immersive. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works very well for blocking out sounds like fans, A/C, and general indoor chatter, making your commute much quieter. The only real downside is the ANC struggles a bit with loud, sudden noises outdoors, and the system voice announcements are quite loud. Verdict: If you want incredible battery life, heavy bass, and good features like ANC and LDAC without spending a fortune, these are a top choice.

Other brands charge like almost double for all these features. All the features mentioned works like a charm. Also the looks stand out compared to other competitive products. # There's just one con that the ""NIRVANA"" badging on the case is not of very good quality as the letters come out after some days due to poor quality glue used. Solution - 1: Either you remove all the letter then it would look good as nirvana is engraved on the case where the letters stick. Solution - 2: Or apply feviquick with the help of a needle and stick the letters again and it's never gonna get off ever again.

1763666023,B0DGV56J6G,R1BT4JMSCZBC5L,Good product..,"Okay product, suitable for my ears who cannot accommodate regular ear buds.. My reviews: 1. The product, its design in itself is good.. It's battery back-up is unbelievably large as compared to its size. 2. It fits in any kind of ear and shows a good balance between music and environmental awareness. 3. It has an impressive Mike- that captures your voice.. Yet they cannot catch the low intensity voice. Some drawbacks and suggestions. 1. There is no problem with the air clips but the case has its own problems- like it does not show how much battery is remaining in it. 2. The magnets are loose so one needs to adjust the airclips inside the after placing them. 3. The airclips get automatically connected with the device even when they are inside the case and the case is in your pocket!-because the magnets are loose! 4. As the case is tiny, it's power backup is less. (The battery's shelf-life also seems to be less.) Else all is fine.. A recommended product for the people like me whose ears do not accept the regular ear buds. 6. Has a weak connection capacity.

1763666023,B0DGV56J6G,R1UNTOUU61922F,My Review of Noise Pure Pods (Power Black),"I bought these earbuds yesterday, and honestly, I’m super impressed with them so far. 🔋 Battery Life: The claim of up to 80 hours seems true — I used them almost the whole day, and the battery barely moved. That’s a huge relief compared to my old earbuds. 🎶 Sound Quality: The 16mm custom drivers make a real difference. The bass feels punchy, vocals are clear, and the overall balance is perfect whether it’s music, movies, or even phone calls. 🎧 Noise Cancellation: The Environmental Noise Cancellation works well, especially during calls. Even in a noisy background, the person on the other side could hear me clearly. 💦 Build & Comfort: The ear hook design (Pure Band) makes them sit securely on the ears, which is great for workouts or biking. Plus, the IPX5 water resistance means I don’t have to worry about sweat or rain. ⚡ First Impression: For something I just bought, the comfort, sound quality, and battery life are way above my expectations. The matte black design also looks very premium. 👉 Verdict (Day 1): Totally worth the price!

1763666026,	B0DN171184,R1U94V0VTNY2OJ,"Ordered second time, as good call quality and average sound and best battery","Product Review for boAt Nirvana Ion True Wireless Earbuds I recently purchased the boAt Nirvana Ion True Wireless Earbuds, and after using them for a while, here’s my detailed review. Design & Comfort (4.5/5) The earbuds come in a sleek, pebble-shaped charging case with an LED indicator, giving them a premium look. The matte finish on the earbuds provides a solid grip, and they feel comfortable in the ears, even during long listening sessions. Multiple ear tip sizes ensure a snug fit. Audio Performance (4.5/5) The 10mm drivers deliver powerful sound with dual EQ modes – boAt Signature Sound for deep bass lovers and Balanced Mode for a more natural sound. The Crystal Bionic Sound with HiFi® DSP enhances audio clarity, making music and calls sound crisp. Battery Life (5/5) One of the best features of these earbuds is their 120-hour battery life (including the case). Each earbud lasts 24 hours on a single charge, which is impressive. This makes them perfect for long trips without worrying about frequent charging. Call Quality & Connectivity (4/5) The quad-mic setup with ENx™ technology significantly reduces background noise during calls. The person on the other end hears your voice clearly. The earbuds support Bluetooth 5.2, ensuring a stable connection with no noticeable lag. Gaming & Additional Features (4/5) With a 60ms low-latency mode, gaming and watching videos are smooth, with minimal audio delay. They also feature in-ear detection, pausing playback when removed from the ears, which is a convenient touch. Final Verdict (4.5/5) The boAt Nirvana Ion earbuds offer excellent sound, a stylish design, and an unmatched battery life at an affordable price. If you’re looking for budget-friendly earbuds with premium features, these are a great choice. Pros: ✔️ Excellent battery life (120 hours) ✔️ Great sound with dual EQ modes ✔️ Comfortable fit and premium design ✔️ Low-latency mode for gaming ✔️ Clear call quality with quad mics Cons: ❌ No Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) ❌ Touch controls could be more responsive Would I recommend it?

1763666026,	B0DN171184,R11MLXIFRWIO1Y,Strongly Recommending Nirvana Ion ANC,"First time using any earbud. It was recommended by one of my friend. Ordered it. Was using it for little more than1 hr everyday for last 14 days. Pros: 1. Sounds great. Boat's signature sound which is bass boosted feels great. 2. Boat Hearables app also customizes best suitable audio type only for you with its amazing hearing test. Apart from that you get to adjust your audio on your own. Sound gets 8.5/10 from me. 3. Other side of the phone says crystal clear sound they can hear from me. Works great even in very low tone. Clarity worked damn well even in fish market, traffic, puja pandals with loud mikes. Will rate 10/10 on calling clarity. 4. Great touch features. Next song, previous song, pause, anc mode> anc off> ambient mode, signature sound> balanced sound, call receive and cut etc are smoothy operative from touch features. For volume only you need to open phone. Touch gets 9/10 from me. 5. Charged 1st time and dat was the last time since these 14days. Battery status 100% in both buds and 91% in case. Terrific battery life. Gets 10/10. 6. In ear detection is great. Music/video pause when ear bud is taken out of ear. 7. Fits great in my ear. Does not get loose while running. 3types of rubber is given with the box for your ear type. 8. Ambient Feature is absolutely good thing while you are walking in road or traffic, you need to hear the sourround too. However, it should work with lesser dB sound too. As it seems it working in short distance when the vehile has approached considerably. If it is a truck/bus the noise/horn is louder from long back so you get time to be aware. But if it is a car or bike unless it horns you wont be able to be aware well in advanced. This thing I dnt know may not be expected in this low budget. Even with out the earbuds been connected to bluetooth it reduces the sourrounding sound considerably without ambident mode on. Cons: Just one con I must admit is the Boat Hearable app. It does not work without GPS. However there is absolutely no necessity of this app to be installed if you are pretty happy with the boats signature sound/ balanced sound. Only if you want to customize your auido you need it. Also, you need it if you want to turn on/off the feature for mutiple device connections. Did not use that feature yet. Conclusion: I strongly recommend it.

So that i cannot control it's features. It also disconnects on its own and could not be able to connect only after a while or an hour. Now, it even gives this crackling sounds while hearing to music. I use my earphones for music and audio only. As an audiophile, i really hated this product. While contacting the Amazon Customer Service, they said that they couldn't return or refund my money. I had contacted them the second day itself after buying. Now it has been more than the 7 days replacement i know but it has been negligence from them when i requested for a replacement that time itself which was early and was eligible for the replacement.

And it spooked me particularly when at a time i was using the left ear bud 'only' becoz no audio at all, got me looking over for volume controls, relaunching music....putting the bud back to case and waking it up again...retrying -The other day it started working... seems intermittent so i am kind of unsure what may come further !! -battery back-up is a disappointment !

The charging box lid is not tight, it easily opens and the earbuds looks good but when you hold it, it looks cheap. Connectivity is fast, as soon as you open a lid the Bluetooth connects easily to the device. It supports dual connectivity but if it is connected to one device then it takes time to connect the second device sometimes it doesn't connect and then you have to unpair or disconnect with the first device. Second issue I observed is after few hours of listening to movies, games and song the right earbud and left earbud were not in sync. I use to hear song in right ear first and then in left ear. Because of this problem I replaced the product but I found this in second product as well so I returned the product. Third thing I didn't like is it's resetting. In manual it is mentioned how to reset the earbuds but it didn't work for me for both times. I even searched on YouTube on how to reset the noise aura earbuds but couldn't find any video particularly for this product. Noise does not provide extra soft earbuds at this price the competitors are providing extra pair. Bass is ok, don't expect much and noise cancellation is also ok, you can hear surrounding voices at home in full volume when listing songs. In traffic or outside if you are on call then other person will hear surrounding sounds Only one thing I loved is the Battery, it is very good. But noise have to work hard on the product development and enhancement. Touch is good not great and not bad as well. It works. Single touch increases or reduces the volume. When you want to use doublenor tripple touch to change the songs etc then it might not work accordingly. It will keep changing volumes. I didn't like this product.

Sound Quality: The audio output is impressive — whether I’m listening to music, watching movies, or attending meetings, the sound is always clear and immersive. I rarely have to turn the volume up too high, and the bass feels well-balanced without being overwhelming. Call & Mic Performance: Call quality has been consistently reliable. Voices come through crisp and clear, and even during outdoor calls, the mic captures my voice well without much disturbance. It performs equally well indoors. Comfort & Fit: The earbuds fit comfortably and stay secure even during longer use. No ear fatigue, which is a plus for daily usage. Battery Life: Battery performance is solid. A full charge comfortably lasts through multiple uses across the day without needing to recharge frequently. Dual Pairing Feature: One of my favorite features is dual pairing — being able to connect both my phone and laptop simultaneously is super convenient, especially when I’m switching between calls and media.

Battery like is good as well (8hrs on each bud. Need to charge the case every 1-2 days if you're a heavy user. If you connect via Google quick connect then in the bluetooth settings you can see the battery percentage of each bud. The app is terrible for tablet devices and if you want to change the mode( like from anc mode--> normal mode) when you are using only one earbud, it tells u to connect both buds. Which defeatz the whole purpose of the app because half your controls you wanted to change are on the other earbud. In ear detection is very good Anc mode works well.

1764168145,	B0DN171184,R24W0QIOP3SL6K,All Unwanted Features!! Dont Buy!!,"I used to earlier use Boat141 earpods, it was an okay product so brought this Boat Nirvana ION earpods, thinking it will be better then Boat 141, but unforunately it is one of the worst earpods i have used. 1. The sound quality was claimed superior, but not much difference in sound quality as compared to Boat 141. 2. There is this feature that turns off the earpods, only way to turn it on again is to put it back in the case and remove it to turn it ON and no feature to disable it (its a painful feature). 3. There is a feature where you remove your earpods from the ears, it pauses the audio (till now its fine) but if you dont put it back on to your ears within 5 seconds, it disconnects the bluetooth and to reconnect you have again remove the case put it back in the case and again put it on to the ears and again connect the bluetooth (so if you are speaking to someone or just remove your earpods hear an announcement in tain and put it back you are gone) . Thankfully they updated the earpods software and gave an optio to disable it. 4. If you switch between two apps like if i am hearing music on amazon music and if switch to amazon prime or facebook and start watching something there and the audio needs to switch, it most of the times disconnects the bluetooth and again you to put it in the case and put it back to connect and many times you have to do this multiple times to connect. 5. If i am travelling and if i tap the earpods to pause or if my hand or someone elses hand touchs my earpods and it pauses audio and disconnects and again to connect back to the phone i have put the earpods back to the case and put it back to connect. 6. If i pause the music on my amazon music app, many times it disconnects the earpods from the phone and again if i have to connect the bluetooth again i have to put it back in the case and again put it back to ears to connect. 7. The touch sensor of the earpods is in between the silver circle on the boat logo which is very sensitive doesnt work incase of a tap and most of the time if i tap and it pauses the audio it also disconnects the earpods and if earpods get disconnected then to connect back i have to put it back to the case and re-connect. 8. Earpods randomly disconnects from the phone and to connect back i have to put it back to the case and reconnect is painful. 9. When i first want to connect the earpods to the phone the bluetooth needs to be first on to be connected if i put the earppods on and then turn on the phone bluetooth it doesnt connect and even in first case where i keep the bluetooth on and then try to connect the earpods it takes multiple attempts to connect the blueetooth to the phone. 10. They have an APP called boat hearables to support the earpods, which pops up whenver I put the earpods on to my ears asking connect the earpods, and when i try to connect the earpods through the APP it trys for 5 minutes and then comes back telling me it cant connect because the phone has not been connected to the bluetooth, so if I have to connect the earpods to the phone manually then only the app will connect to the earpods then why does the APP ask me to connect the earpods to phone when it cannot, when i connect the phone to the earpods manually it should also connect the app to the earpods instead of popping up messages asking to connect the earpods to the APP and then failing to do so. THE EARPODS ARE VERY PAINFULL TO USE, THE BLUETOOTH DISCONNECTS VERY RANDOMLY AND FOR EVERYTHING AND TO RECONNECT PUTTING IT BACK TO THE CASE AND PUTTING IT ON IS PAINFULL TASK CONSIDERING I AND MANY LIKE ME USE THE EARPODS WHILE TRAVELLING IN TRAINS AND METRO AND THERE IS NO FEATURE TO TURN THIS FEATURE OFF.",1.0,https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R24W0QIOP3SL6K,Ninad,Reviewed in India on 27 June 2024,1,146 people found this helpful,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ijNFuBFgL.jpg""]",2025-11-26T14:42:25.071846

The brand boasts about being the best Indian brand, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. They slap high-end terms like “ANC” and “SPATIAL” on their products, but it’s all just marketing gimmicks. The so-called ANC is an absolute joke—you can hear every little sound around you, making the feature completely useless. To make things even worse, their app is poorly designed. Not everyone wears both earphones at the same time, and I often use just one, but the app doesn't even support that. As a result, the sound quality becomes unbearably bad. It’s frustrating beyond words. The biggest regret? I didn’t just buy one—I bought two of these useless products. Both have turned out to be a complete waste of money. The sound is terrible, the features are non-functional, and the brand clearly has no intention of delivering quality. All they care about is making money while fooling customers with false claims.

They refused to understand that this product can't be used by me due to the ill fitting nature of the buds. A loss of 3k. And honestly not worth it. As you can see from the pictures. The plastic seems cheap and lacks finish. As does the default sounds on pairing up, it is loud and harsh and impervious to volume control. Music plays fine. The features are otherwise as mentioned. But as a customer. The service and lack of clarity on return/refund is infuriating and honestly not something to uphold by a company that prides itself on the Indian market.

The listing did not make it clear that the product was non-returnable, nor did it provide any accessible information about how to claim a warranty from the manufacturer — if one even exists. At this point, I just want to know how I can get help — either through a warranty claim or some kind of replacement or refund process.

1765006486,	B0F673HNLP,R3HRMZL11PWAUX,Very disappointed with the purchase 😞 #Purchase #Disappointment #Shopping,"Alright, the fit's okay. I had the Huawei FreeClip before, and these Noise Clip 2s feel a bit bigger and different. They seem kinda bulky compared to the FreeClips, which are, like, 11k more on sale, but they're light enough to wear for a while. I wanted clip-on OWS because I wear glasses and have small ears. Other OWS styles don't work with glasses or hurt my ears. Here's what's good: 1. They're light on my ears. Fit is good enough for my small ears 2. The battery's good, lasting about 5 1/2 hours. 3. The case feels light. 4. Call quality is manageable. Only tried it at home.. Here's what's not so good: 1. They feel like cheap plastic for 3.2k. 2. The volume is super low. That's the biggest issue, defeats the purpose of buds. I also have Truke Liberty OWS, which cost less than half the price. Truke sounds better and louder. I'm really bummed about the sound on the Noise Clip 2. It makes me regret buying them. They sound okay inside the house, where it's quiet (people can easily hear what is playing). You can barely hear anything if people are talking around you. Outside, they're pretty useless. You can barely hear anything, even at full volume. 3. No app from Noise. For 3.2k, they should have basic settings through an app. 4. The gesture controls are weird. Triple tap to play/pause, double tap to answer/end. The gestures are glitchy. They work sometimes, but sometimes you have to try multiple times. I have Truke liberty Ows, tozo ows and huawei freeclips. Based on my experience with other premium, mid range and entry level ows this is a disappointing buy. I expected at least decent performance for the price. I was busy with other things and missed the return window.

The earbuds have a very comfortable and secure fit, making them great for long listening sessions. Touch controls are responsive and pretty easy to operate. Voice calling quality is also very good, with clear audio on both ends, making it great for work calls or chats on the go. However, the ANC performance is below expectations. It hardly makes a noticeable difference in noisy environments. The charging case could also be more user-friendly. Putting the earbuds back in isn’t intuitive, and I still need to look carefully to align them properly into the case.

1765982735,B0DXPL5XHF,R19H9S9JZ4LI5K,NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED AS THERE IS NO HELP TO CUSTOMER FROM AMAZON OR BOAT WITHIN THE RETURN WINDOW,"The sound is ok. The worst part of this is the service from Boat. I purchased it exactly 4 days back and when I try to sink my Zenith Pro to Boat Hearables application 75% of the times my Zenith Pro is not even being recognised another 25% of the times its being recognised and when I try to connect it, its not getting connected and shows different trouble shooting steps like charge earphones, keep it near by your device etc etc which is already being done. After multiple attempts as it is not getting connected & as it is within the return / replacement window I contacted Amazon for assistance and they were like I need to contact brand only even during the return window period. As Amazon doesn’t help us I went to the manufacturer(Boat) for assistance and when I reached out to their service center and explained them the problem they heard everything tried from their end and even they were not able to connect it. Now to my shocker they ask me to come back to the service center after the return window is closed as they cannot do anything within the return window. They wants me to come once the return window in Amazon closes that is when they can look into the issue. So here if Boat & Amazon cannot help the customer within the 7 days replacement / return window why do we even have that window mentioned? If they remove it then I can directly get it serviced from Boat. Now I am at a point where my new ear phones are not getting connected but I am unable to do anything rather than just waiting for return window to close on Amazon so that I can try my luck with service center. AGAIN NOT SURE ON WHAT RESOLUTION THE SERVICE CENTER PROVIDES ME AFTER THE RETURN WINDOW. So a sincere suggestion to all the people who are thinking of buying it IT’S A BIG NO AS BOTH AMAZON & BOAT TEAMS DOESN’T HELP THE CUSTOMER. Also it is not at all worth the price.
